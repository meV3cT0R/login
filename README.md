## Introduction
Functional login page using React that validates user credentials against a provided API and handles success and error scenarios appropriately. If the credentials are correct (username: username, password: password), user is redirected to a second page at the route /welcome.
If the credentials are incorrect, appropriate error message is shown to the user.
/welcome is protected meaning it can't be accessed without Authentication.
